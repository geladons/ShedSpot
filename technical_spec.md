# Technical Specification: WordPress Multi-Vendor Booking & Service Marketplace Plugin

This plugin will be a comprehensive **all-in-one booking and services marketplace** for WordPress, combining appointment scheduling (like Amelia) with a marketplace for workers/services (like TaskRabbit). It will provide distinct **roles** (Client/Customer, Worker/Vendor, Administrator), each with their own dashboards and profile pages, and support flexible customization, modern interfaces, and extensibility. Key features include: a precise booking calendar (with Google Calendar sync), service catalog and sales, flexible scheduling, personal accounts with messaging and invoicing, and integration with WooCommerce for payments. The system will be modular and API-driven (full WP REST API support) to allow future extensions (bots, mobile apps, etc.). The code will follow WordPress best practices (hooks, custom post types, Settings API, i18n, etc.) and be structured in clear modules so new developers can easily maintain and extend it.

## Plugin Architecture & Code Structure

* **Modular codebase:** Organize code into directories like `includes/`, `admin/`, `public/`, `assets/` (css, js, images), `templates/`, and `languages/` (for translations). Use classes and namespaces (PSR-4 autoloading) to separate functionality (e.g. BookingManager, UserManager, PaymentGateway, APIHandler, etc.). Avoid “god” objects or monolithic files. Each module should register WordPress hooks (actions/filters) to integrate with WP and allow customization. Code should be well-commented (PHPDoc style) and follow WP coding standards.

* **REST API & Extensibility:** Expose core functionality via the **WordPress REST API**. Create custom routes/endpoints (with unique namespace/version) for bookings, services, users, etc., using `register_rest_route()` on `rest_api_init`. This lets external apps/bots access and update data. Use WP actions and filters liberally so other devs can modify behavior without touching core code. For example, provide filter hooks on query parameters, email notifications, and display templates.

* **Plugin Settings (Admin):** In the WP admin dashboard, add a top-level menu for plugin settings. Use the **Settings API** (register\_setting, add\_settings\_section, add\_settings\_field) to create pages for general settings, payment integrations, system fees, etc. For example, a “Booking Settings” page can register options (e.g. default time zones, notification templates), and render form fields via callbacks. Provide both **Quick Setup** (basic defaults) and **Advanced Mode** (fine-grained options) toggles. Also add a “Settings” link on the plugin’s row in `plugins.php` for easy access.

* **Internationalization (i18n):** Write all user-facing text in English (the default locale) and wrap it in translation functions (`__()`, `_e()`, `_n()`). Load the plugin text domain so translations can be added later. This will allow easy localization (the plugin should support switching languages via .pot/.po files). For now, the plugin UI will be in English by default, with placeholders for other languages.

* **Custom Post Types & Data:** Use **Custom Post Types (CPTs)** for structured data. For example, register CPTs like `service` (to list available services or products), `booking` (to store each appointment/order), and possibly `worker_profile` if needed. As WP docs explain, CPTs provide a full admin UI for management. Custom taxonomies can categorize services (e.g. service type). Store scheduling data as meta fields on bookings or separate tables if needed. Avoid custom tables unless data cannot fit WP’s posts/meta model. Leverage built-in user and post metadata for extra fields (hourly rates, location, etc.).

* **Security & Standards:** Follow WP guidelines: validate/sanitize all inputs, use nonces for form security, and prevent direct file access (`if ( ! defined('ABSPATH') ) exit;`). Use `current_user_can()` to check capabilities before sensitive actions. Clean up on deactivation (remove custom roles or options) and on uninstall (delete data if desired). Adhere to WP coding standards (naming, braces, etc.).

## User Roles & Access Control

* **Client (Customer):** Represents the end-user who requests services. By default, a new registered user is a “Customer” role (could extend WP’s Subscriber or create a custom role). Customers can browse services, create bookings, pay invoices, view their history, send messages, and leave reviews/tips after payment. In their dashboard, they see pending/confirmed bookings, messages from workers/admin, invoices, and stats (e.g. total spent).

* **Worker (Vendor):** Represents a service provider or contractor. This is a custom role (e.g. “Worker”) with capabilities to manage their own availability, accept bookings, and view their earnings. Workers can enable/disable services provided (as set up by admin), set their own hourly rates per service, and view incoming booking requests. Each booking is initially “pending” until worker accepts or requests a deposit. Workers can modify booking times or costs by communicating with the client through the messaging system. After job completion, workers finalize details (actual start/end times, additional charges like parking, notes) and mark it “completed,” triggering invoice issuance to the client.

* **Administrator:** The site admin has full control. By default the admin role can act like a Worker (for any open job) or switch to “Customer mode” if needed. Admin interface includes plugin-wide settings (e.g. system fee per hour, commission rates), viewing all bookings, and managing users. The admin can assign or modify roles (`add_role`, `remove_role` on activation/deactivation hooks), and edit user accounts (e.g. change a Customer to Worker). The admin can also monitor all client-worker dialogues, intervene in conversations, and override bookings.

* **Capabilities:** Leverage WordPress’s roles/capabilities system. On plugin activation, use `add_role()` to create new roles (“worker”, “customer”) with specific caps (e.g. `read` = true, plus custom capabilities). For example, a Worker might have caps like `edit_booking`, `publish_booking`, while Customers can only `create_booking` and `read_invoice`. Use `add_cap()` on existing roles if needed (e.g. giving admins any new capability). Always perform role/cap adjustments in activation hooks, not on every page load. As WP docs note, this system “allows for user roles with specific capabilities” and creates a hierarchy where some users have more access.

## Booking & Scheduling System

* **Service Catalog & Booking Flow:** Admin defines a catalog of **services** (or products) that can be booked or purchased. Each service has details: name, description, base duration (if fixed or range), price model (hourly or fixed-fee), and optional extras. Workers can enable which services they offer and set their own **hourly rate** (if service is time-based). For fixed-price services, the admin sets the worker’s fee and the platform’s commission. On the front end, clients start a booking by selecting a service, optionally choosing extras, a date/time, estimated duration, and preferably a specific worker (or let the system auto-assign). The booking form should allow adding many detail fields (like location, notes) to precisely describe the job.

* **Service Area & Geofencing:**

    * ***Data Model:*** Each Worker may define a service area by selecting either a radius (center coordinates + radius in km) or drawing a polygon on a map (stored as GeoJSON).
    * ***Client Address Input:*** During booking, the client enters an address or uses browser geolocation. The system reverse-geocodes to coordinates.
    * ***Matching Logic:*** The booking algorithm filters Workers by checking if client coordinates fall within a Worker’s service area (radius or polygon).
    * ***UI Controls:*** In Worker dashboard, include an interactive map (e.g. Leaflet/Google Maps) to draw service boundaries. In booking form, prompt address with autocomplete (Google Places API).

* **Availability & Slot Calculation:** The plugin will calculate free time slots by checking each worker’s existing bookings, working hours, and service-area match. It must avoid double-booking. We allow granular slot lengths (minutes or hours) so clients can pick exact time ranges. The booking wizard will show only slots where at least one chosen or eligible worker (based on area) is free. Optionally, offer a **“first available worker”** mode where system auto-assigns the next free and in-area worker at the requested time.

* **Booking Confirmation & Security:** After a client picks a slot, they confirm by entering an OTP code sent via SMS (supporting services like Twilio, Nexmo, Google Voice). At this step, prompt the user to set a password for future logins; however, allow passwordless login if desired (using SMS each time). Once confirmed, the booking is created (status “pending worker confirmation”) and the worker/admin is notified to accept or request deposit.

* **Deposits & Payments:** Support **WooCommerce integration** to handle payments via popular gateways (Stripe, PayPal, etc.). We’ll let bookings generate a WooCommerce order/invoice. For hourly work, the final cost is “hours × rate + admin fee (system fee per hour).” For fixed-price services, apply the pre-set fee + commission. Workers can optionally request a **deposit** before confirming. After a job is marked complete, an invoice is sent for any remaining balance. Clients can tip and leave a review on payment.

* **Calendar View:** Provide calendar views for workers and admin (daily/weekly/monthly). Workers see their booked slots, free time, and service-area overlays. Admin sees all bookings and can filter by worker, service, or region. Admin can manually add a booking (e.g. phone orders). Customers see upcoming bookings in their dashboard, but not a public calendar.

## Front-End Experience

* **Personal Dashboards:** Each role has a dedicated front-end dashboard page (not the WP admin). These are “applications” built via shortcodes or Gutenberg blocks. For example, `[my_booking_dashboard]` could render the customer dashboard. On activation, the plugin will auto-create necessary pages (e.g. “Account Dashboard”, “Book Now” pages) using `register_activation_hook` and `wp_insert_post()`, inserting the appropriate shortcodes. The dashboards will show data (bookings, messages, statistics) and allow interaction (edit profile, set availability, change settings). The design should be clean and responsive. We will provide several **front-end themes/templates** (light, dark, corporate, etc.) that admins can choose from in plugin settings for quick styling.

* **Booking Forms / Single-Page App:** The booking interface should be a modern, user-friendly form (potentially a step-by-step wizard). The client booking page can function as a SPA (single-page app) using AJAX or a JavaScript framework, or as an embedded application via shortcode/block. For example, the plugin can register a Gutenberg block (with proper render callback) or a shortcode that outputs a `<div id="booking-app"></div>` that our JS app binds to. We will add block patterns for easy insertion in the block editor if applicable. Admins can choose in settings whether to use an AJAX/SPA approach or a simpler page (for example, toggling between a full React-based booking app vs. classic form with page reloads).

* **Pages & Shortcodes:** The plugin will automatically create key pages: e.g. “All Services” (listing all bookable services), “My Account” (dashboard), and “Book Service” (the booking interface). Each will have a unique shortcode or block. Users can also insert these into any page: e.g. `[booking_form service_id="123"]`. We will provide shortcodes for forms, user profile editing, message center, etc. All templates will use our CSS classes so the look can be customized via plugin settings or child themes.

* **Messaging/Notifications:** Implement an internal messaging system (or integrate with a known plugin like Better Messages) so clients and workers can exchange messages. Messages should appear in both users’ dashboards and optionally be emailed to prompt login. Also send email/SMS notifications on key events (booking request, confirmation, reminders). These notifications should be customizable templates in settings. Use WordPress mail functions or WooCommerce emails.

## Administrator Interface

* **Global Settings:** In WP Admin, under our plugin’s menu, add screens for:

    * **General Settings:** default time zone, date/time format, currency, contact email.
    * **Booking Settings:** default slot length, minimum notice, cancellation policy text.
    * **Payment Settings:** WooCommerce toggles, commission rates, system fee/hour (flat markup added to all worker rates), multi-currency options (leveraging WooCommerce currency settings).
    * **SMS/2FA Settings:** configure SMS gateway API keys (Twilio, Nexmo, etc.).
    * **Email/SMS Templates:** editable templates for booking confirmation, reminders, etc.

* **User Management:** The admin panel will include tools to view all customers and workers. From each user’s profile, admin can switch their role (customer/worker), change details, or log in as that user. Show statistics for each user (number of bookings, earnings or spend). Admin can see any conversation and even intervene. Use WP’s user profile editing screens enhanced with extra fields (e.g. “role”).

* **Analytics Dashboard:** Provide admin dashboard widgets or pages summarizing overall stats: total bookings, revenue, pending requests, monthly charts, top services, etc. Use charts/graphs for quick insight.

* **Modular Extensions:** Architect the plugin so new modules (e.g. Loyalty Points, Video Chat, Group Bookings) can be plugged in. For example, follow WooCommerce’s approach to extensibility (like Product Add-Ons or AutomateWoo) by using filters. For critical logic (e.g. fee calculations), apply filters to let extensions modify behavior.

## Customization & Themes

* **Frontend Theming:** Offer multiple preset themes (light, dark, color variations). Admin can switch theme in settings; the plugin will enqueue corresponding CSS files. Allow basic customization of colors/fonts via a simple interface (using WP Customizer API) or upload of a logo. Also allow custom CSS field for advanced tweaks.

* **Multi-language Ready:** As noted, all strings use `__()` for translation. Provide a `.pot` file. Integrate with WPML or Polylang if needed for multiple languages (though initially English-only). Text domain follows plugin folder name.

* **Shortcodes & Widgets:** In addition to blocks, offer traditional shortcodes for all features (booking form, profile, service list) so the plugin works even if not using Gutenberg. This follows WP plugin best practices for compatibility.

## Integration & Future Extensions

* **WooCommerce Integration:** Deep integration with WooCommerce is a must. For payments, bookings should create Woo orders so any Woo gateway can be used. Optionally, allow selling “service packages” as Woo products. Administrators can install WooCommerce add-ons (like Deposits, Vendors) alongside for extra functionality.

* **Calendar/Meeting Sync:** Sync each booking with Google Calendar (two-way) so users get reminders. Integrate with online meeting tools (Zoom) by auto-generating meeting links. Support ICS export.

* **Communication APIs:** Prepare for voice/SMS by building an API layer. For example, integrate with Twilio or Google Voice to send SMS codes or call reminders. Use webhooks to handle inbound calls/SMS if needed.

* **Mobile & Bots:** Because the plugin will expose a REST API, mobile apps or chatbots can be built on top. Provide API documentation or use WordPress standards so developers (or a neural code generator) can build on it easily.

* **Modular Structure:** Design as an MVC-like system. For front-end and admin, separate controllers, models, and templates. For example, have separate classes for BookingController (handles requests), BookingModel (data), and booking templates (views). This improves maintainability and allows future devs to swap implementations (e.g. use a different database for scalability).

* **Performance:** Optimize queries (e.g. WP\_Query with meta\_query for availability). Use caching (transients) for data that doesn’t change often (like service list). Lazy-load scripts for calendars and large interfaces. Keep template files small and logic in PHP classes.

## Development Process & Code Quality

* **Team-Friendly Code:** Since multiple developers may work on this, enforce style guidelines (WordPress PHP standards) and write PHPDoc. Split large features into smaller functions/methods with clear responsibilities. Keep functions under \~100 lines where possible.

* **Documentation:** Along with code comments, maintain a developer README and in-code docs. Use meaningful class/method names. Provide examples of how to hook into the plugin (e.g. actions to extend a booking, filters to adjust pricing).

* **Version Control:** Use git from day one. Tag releases and document changes (changelog). Write unit/integration tests for core logic if possible.

* **Security and Privacy:** Ensure user data is sanitized/escaped. If storing personal data, comply with GDPR (offer data export/erase via WP tools). As required by WP Plugin Handbook, prevent direct access to PHP files.

## Additional Features to Consider

* **Service Provider Applications:** On the front-end, provide buttons like “I want to work with you” and “Sell my services here”. These link to forms where new users register as Workers/Vendors with guided onboarding, including profile verification.

* **Reviews & Ratings:** After each completed booking, automatically prompt customers for ratings and reviews. Aggregate average ratings on service and worker profiles to help future bookings.

* **Coupons & Discounts:** Integrate with WooCommerce coupons so admins and workers can offer discounts on services or bundle packages.

* **Waitlist & Notifications:** For fully booked time slots, allow clients to join a waitlist. When a cancellation occurs, send immediate notifications to waitlisted clients.

* **Attachments & Portfolio:** Allow workers to upload project photos, certifications, or sample work to their profile. Clients can attach files or images to booking requests for clarity.

* **Automated Reminders & Follow‑Ups:** Schedule email/SMS reminders before jobs (e.g. 24/1 hour prior) and follow-up messages post-completion to solicit feedback or offer repeat booking discounts.

* **Advanced Reporting & Exports:** Extend the analytics dashboard with exportable CSV/Excel reports on bookings, revenue per worker, busiest services, geographic heat maps, and tax summaries.

* **Geo-Analytics & Heatmaps:** Use booking location data to generate heatmaps of service demand per region, helping admins and workers optimize coverage areas.

* **AI‑Powered Suggestions:** Implement optional AI modules (as future plugins) to suggest optimal time slots based on historical data, recommend workers for specific jobs, or auto-generate descriptions for services.

* **PWA/Mobile App Support:** Architect front-end JS as a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing offline caching of booking forms and push notifications for reminders.

* **Multisite & White‑Label Friendly:** Ensure compatibility with WordPress Multisite, enabling agencies to spin up service marketplaces for different domains. Provide white‑label settings so clients can rebrand interfaces.

* **Accessibility & Compliance:** Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility. Provide GDPR/CCPA data export and deletion features for user privacy.

* **Third‑Party Marketplace Integrations:** Plan connectors for popular platforms (e.g., Zapier, Integromat) to automate workflows: Slack alerts, CRM sync, email marketing triggers.

---

*All new modules should follow the same modular structure (MVC, PSR-4), register their own hooks, and adhere to the plugin’s coding standards.*
